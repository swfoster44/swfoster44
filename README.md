### Just a guy fascinated with programming and technology.
Trying to give back to the open source community that has helped me so much. 

### Street cred
* Been in the game since 2001
* NeoVim user.
* Linux user. Ok I use windows for gaming.

## Languages
* JavaScript: Eldritch abomination rising from the darkness to consume the earth. Got to admit it does some cool stuff.
* Python: The cult is a little scary. Good language.
* Rust: Couldn't stay awake while reading the documentation. Would love to learn it.
* C: The manliest of all languages... Until you're crying in the corner because of some memory bs. A classic I'm trying to learn.
* C++: When the abyss stares back. Another classic.
* PHP: The best templating engine ever made. It has its uses....
* C#: There is no reason to ever use this language.
